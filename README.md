HowToWriteAWebApplication
=========================

In which I write a silly kid's computer game and in the process teach you how to code a web application.

I should note here that this isn't the game system.  This is the book about writing the game system.

The purpose of the book is purely to educate the interested reader in the workings of a web system via the
development of a game I want to make for my kids to play. It will also help to provide a curriculum for a class
I intend to teach.  This system will be written in node.js - but I am no particular advocate for node over
php or ruby or c# or Java.  It is simply the environment in which I Currently enjoy working.
